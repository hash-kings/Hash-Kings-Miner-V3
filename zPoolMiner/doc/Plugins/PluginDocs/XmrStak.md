`Xmr-Stak` is currently the only miner that is supported on all device types in NHM. It relies heavily on a file-based config system, which replaces ELPs for it.

## Intensity

Intensity is tweaked through the config files, elaborated in the next section. For adjusting CPU intensity, modify the `cached_AlgorithmName_CPU.json` config template and remove/add entries of `cpu_threads_conf`.

## Config

In the `miner_plugins\XmrStak` directory open configs folder.
```
├───bins
├───configs
└───internals
```

There will be a couple of config files. 
```
├───configs
│       cached_CryptoNightHeavy_CPU.json
│       cached_CryptoNightR_NVIDIA.json
│       CryptoNightHeavy_CPU.txt
│       CryptoNightR_NVIDIA.txt
```

These will be generated on the first time running `Xmr-Stak` by NHM. These are files generated for CPU, AMD, and NVIDIA configs. Generally, each file will have two types of copies:

* A config copy that was generated by `Xmr-Stak` - `*.txt` file
* A template generated by `NHM`, serving as config template - `*.json` file

Since NHM is using JSON templates to create `Xmr-Stak` configs, only adjust the "template" files. E.g. a template file will look like `cached_CryptoNightR_NVIDIA.json`.

In the template file there will be a section, where you can modify values for each device. ONLY edit `CachedConfig` section, otherwise the settings will be rewritten by default values.
```
{
  "DeviceUUIDs": [
    "GPU-d97bdb7c-4155-9124-31b7-4743e16d3ac0",
    "GPU-b7428649-2ac2-dc40-d330-d1599eda8505"
  ],
  "CachedConfig": {
    "gpu_threads_conf": [
      {
        "index": 0,
        "threads": 4,
        "blocks": 152,
        "bfactor": 6,
        "bsleep": 25,
        "affine_to_cpu": false,
        "sync_mode": 3,
        "mem_mode": 1
      },
      {
        "index": 1,
        "threads": 4,
        "blocks": 80,
        "bfactor": 6,
        "bsleep": 25,
        "affine_to_cpu": false,
        "sync_mode": 3,
        "mem_mode": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The template files all have instructions on how the values can be tweaked.
