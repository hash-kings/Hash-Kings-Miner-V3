<h1 id="plugin">What is a Plugin?</h1>
<p>A plugin is an external or internal dependcy (dll). The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is defined in <b>MinerPlugin</b> project and plugin developers must implement the following interfaces <a href="../../src/Miners/MinerPlugin/IMinerPlugin.cs">IMinerPlugin</a> and <a href="../../src/Miners/MinerPlugin/IMiner.cs">IMiner</a>. This means that you create a new project inside Miners directory and implement all required functions from IMinerPlugin and IMiner interfaces. It is recommended that each one is in its own file (Plugin and Miner file).</p>
<p>Each plugin project should implement at least 1 plugin. You can implement more, but good practice is to keep 1 plugin inside 1 project.
<br><b>IMinerPlugin</b> is used for registering the plugin and there will be only 1 instance created. Its job is to give basic info such as name, UUID, version, etc.
<br><b>IMiner</b> is the mandatory interface for all miners containing bare minimum functionalities and is being used as miner process instance created by IMinerPlugin.</p>
<p>Bare minimum example of plugin is written in <a href="../../src/Miners/ExamplePlugin">Example Plugin</a> project. The <a href="../../src/Miners/ExamplePlugin/ExamplePlugin.cs">Plugin</a> file contains implementation of IMinerPlugin interface for registration and creation of the plugin instance. The <a href="../../src/Miners/ExamplePlugin/ExampleMiner.cs">Miner</a> file contains implementation of IMiner interface, providing required functionalities.</p>

<h1 id="toolkit">What is MinerPluginToolkitV1 used for?</h1>
<p>It is recommended to use <b>MinerPluginToolkitV1</b> as this will enable full integration with NiceHash Miner. It will save time developing it and enable implementation of additional advanced features. If you are writing a plugin we highly recommend that you use MinerPluginToolkitV1. All miner plugins that are developed by NiceHash miner dev team are using MinerPluginToolkitV1. For example you can check <a href="../../src/Miners/GMiner">GMiner Plugin</a>.</p>
<p>MinerPluginToolkitV1 also enables creation of <b>Background Services</b>, check out <a href="../../src/Miners/Ethlargement">Ethlargement plugin</a> for example.</p>
